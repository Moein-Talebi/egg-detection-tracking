## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the main script to process the default video:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration

The system can be configured by modifying the parameters in `main.py`:

```python
# Camera and conveyor parameters
conveyor_length_cm = 75  # Conveyor length in cm
camera_height_cm = 70    # Camera height from conveyor in cm

# File paths
model_path = r'model\best.pt'
video_path = r'input\gettyimages-2202523239-640_adpp.mp4'
output_video_path = r'output\tracked_eggs_with_sizes.mp4'
```

### Custom Video Processing

To process your own video:

1. Place your video file in the `input/` directory
2. Update the `video_path` in `main.py`
3. Run the script

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Egg Detection
- Uses a custom-trained YOLO model (`best.pt`) for egg detection
- Applies confidence thresholding to filter detections
- Focuses detection within the conveyor belt region

### 2. Object Tracking
- Implements optimized IoU-based tracking algorithm
- Assigns unique IDs to each detected egg
- Handles object disappearance and reappearance

### 3. Size Calculation
- Detects conveyor belt region automatically
- Calculates pixel-to-cm ratio with perspective correction
- Measures egg dimensions in real-world units (cm)

### 4. Analysis and Reporting
- Tracks egg sizes across multiple frames
- Generates statistical analysis
- Outputs detailed reports and annotated videos

## üìä Output

The system generates several outputs:

1. **Tracked Video** (`tracked_eggs_with_sizes.mp4`):
   - Original video with bounding boxes and tracking IDs
   - Real-time size measurements displayed

2. **Size Report** (`egg_size_report.txt`):

   - Average dimensions and statistics
   - Camera and conveyor parameters

3. **Console Output**:
   - Real-time processing progress
   - Summary statistics
   - Performance metrics

## ÔøΩ Code Description

### Core Architecture

The system is built around several key components that work together to provide accurate egg detection and tracking:

#### 1. EggTracker Class
```python
class EggTracker:
    def __init__(self, max_disappeared=5):
        self.next_id = 0
        self.tracks = {}  # track_id: {bbox, last_seen, size_history}
        self.max_disappeared = max_disappeared
```
**Purpose**: Manages object tracking using Intersection over Union (IoU) algorithm
- **Key Features**: 
  - Assigns unique IDs to detected eggs
  - Maintains tracking history for size calculation
  - Handles object disappearance and reappearance
  - Optimized for real-time processing

#### 2. Detection Pipeline
```python
def apply_model_on_frame_with_tracking(model, frame, tracker, horizontal_ratio, vertical_ratio, conveyor_bbox=None):
    # YOLO inference
    results = model(frame, verbose=False)
    
    # Extract and filter detections
    detections = []
    for result in results:
        # Filter by confidence and conveyor region
        
    # Update tracker and calculate sizes
    tracked_objects = tracker.update(detections)
```
**Purpose**: Processes each video frame through the complete detection and tracking pipeline
- **Input**: Video frame, YOLO model, tracker instance
- **Output**: Annotated frame with tracking IDs and size measurements

#### 3. Perspective Correction
```python
def calculate_perspective_corrected_ratio_with_belt_detection(camera_height_cm, conveyor_length_cm, frame, conveyor_bbox=None):
    # Detect conveyor belt region
    conveyor_bbox = detect_conveyor_belt_region(frame)
    
    # Calculate pixel-to-cm ratios
    horizontal_ratio = conveyor_length_cm / conveyor_width_pixels
    vertical_ratio = horizontal_ratio * perspective_factor
```
**Purpose**: Converts pixel measurements to real-world dimensions
- **Features**:
  - Automatic conveyor belt detection using HSV color filtering
  - Camera perspective correction
  - Separate horizontal and vertical scaling ratios

#### 4. Size Calculation Engine
```python
def calculate_egg_size_with_perspective(bbox, horizontal_ratio, vertical_ratio):
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = bbox
    width_pixels = x2 - x1
    height_pixels = y2 - y1
    
    width_cm = width_pixels * horizontal_ratio
    height_cm = height_pixels * vertical_ratio
    
    return width_cm, height_cm
```
**Purpose**: Accurately measures egg dimensions in centimeters
- **Algorithm**: Uses bounding box dimensions with perspective correction
- **Accuracy**: Accounts for camera angle and distance

### Key Algorithms

#### IoU-Based Tracking Algorithm
The tracking system uses Intersection over Union (IoU) to match detections across frames:
1. **Detection Matching**: Calculate IoU between current detections and existing tracks
2. **Assignment**: Use greedy algorithm to assign detections to tracks
3. **Track Management**: Create new tracks for unmatched detections, remove old tracks
4. **Optimization**: Early exit conditions and reduced thresholds for speed

#### Conveyor Belt Detection
Automatic detection of the working area using color-based segmentation:
1. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert BGR to HSV for better color detection
2. **Brown Color Filtering**: Define HSV ranges for conveyor belt colors
3. **Morphological Operations**: Clean up the mask using opening and closing
4. **Contour Detection**: Find the largest contour as the conveyor belt region

#### Performance Optimizations
Multiple optimizations ensure real-time processing:
- **Reduced History**: Keep only 5 frames of size history instead of 10
- **Lower IoU Threshold**: Use 0.2 instead of 0.3 for faster matching
- **Early Filtering**: Skip low-confidence detections immediately
- **Simplified Visualization**: Thinner lines and smaller text for faster rendering
- **Configurable Frame Skipping**: Process every nth frame for speed
